# Introduction
First, thank you for considering contributing to ProjectFilter. Your help is very much appreciated--it's what makes this project well-maintained and accessible for everyone!

By following these guidelines, the contribution process will help developers and contributors communicate more seamlessly. Please be patient and remember to be respectful as the developer(s) to address your issue, assess changes, and help finalize your pull requests.

### Ways to Contribute

All contributions are welcome! There are many ways to contribute. Here are some examples:
- Improving internal and external documentation (README, comments in code, etc.) for readability, simplicity, and better understanding.
- Writing tutorials, blog plosts, or adding demo gifs
- Submitting bug reports
- Writing code and tests

 ***NOTE***: *Please don't use the issue tracker for [support questions].*

# Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. For browsers (Firefox, Chrome, IE) and multiple devices (iOS, Android).
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/)

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:  
  - **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.  
  - **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.  

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.  

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can view: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/  
You can also learn how to contribute from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

For something bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Fork this project
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Commit and push your changes
5. Submit a pull request

Examples of smaller contributions:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# Reporting a Bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email github.airada@gmail.com instead.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to github.airada@gmail.com
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
 * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
 * Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email github.airada@gmail.com.

### How to Submit Bug Report
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

 When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

 1. What version of Angular are you using?
 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
 3. What did you do?
 4. What did you expect to see?
 5. What did you see instead?

# Features or Enhancements
If you have a suggestion for an enhancement or new feature, you're probably not alone. Feel free to open up an issue on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
